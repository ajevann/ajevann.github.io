        <h3>Allow myself to introduce.. myself...</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Alex Vann. Hopefully that was obvious from the main page, if not, I need to do some serious reviewing. I am a developer and economist by trade and study, but to be honest, I've done plenty of things outside of my field. Everything from dishwasher to bread merchant to sailor to general manager of a restaurant to traveller. Each one of these experiences has helped me develop into the person I am today. I have always prided myself on learning to new things quickly and having an insatiable appetite for learning and questioning (much to the chagrin of my parents growing up, constantly asking "Why?").</p>
        <p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Economics from Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, Virginia in May 2012. Since then, I've been taking part in what's called a "gap year" essentially taking a mini-sabatical to travel and work in fields that I will probably not be able to in the future. I was lucky enough to travel throughout the United States (Seattle, New York, Chicago, Tennessee, Raleigh) and through Europe (Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy, France, Austria).</p>
        <p>Professionally, I'm a Richmond, Virginia based software developer with a focusing .NET applications and C#, but really I'm fond of any object-oriented language. In my spare time, I tend to solve <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Euler Problems</a>, rock climb, and go to the movies.</p>
