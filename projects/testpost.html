        <h3>A different way to view CSS...</h3>
        <p>During my boredom, I like to write simple programs to solve sometimes trivial problems. For example, say you are in the process of writing a website with a substantial amount of CSS, so much so that errors are bound to occur, except the errors in question are technically valid. The issue I always came across was how to sift through the CSS code to spot the errors, sometimes without knowing where to start. How can I find inconsistencies quickly and rectify the problems as I see them?</p>
        <p>Rather than search the internet for a solution, I decided I'd try and solve this one on my own. The method I came up with that most suited my likes and preferences was to take the CSS code and somehow insert it into a spreadsheet that would efficiently show the selectors, attributes, and elements in such a fashion that would make errors quickly apparent. </p>
