        <h3>Emailing your IP Address</h3>
        
        <p>Travelling abroad I came across a simple problem that I had not forseen. I needed to get a specific file from my desktop (a comic book if you must know) but I had no way to connect to it. Of course, having cloud space would be useful, however, I use my dropbox account really only for important things like copies of professional documents or things I needed to protect from hardware problems and still be able to grab a copy wherever I am.</p>
        
        <p>So that got me thinking, and since I was just learning python, I decided to try my hand at writing a simple script that would send a copy of my desktop's IP address by email to me. But that introduced a whole other set of possibilities and questions. When to send the IP address? How regularily? What if emails become abnoxious?</p>
        
        <p>I settled on the following solution: Have the computer record the IP address when booting up (How to regulate when the desktop turns on?), save a copy of the IP address somewhere accessible (Dropbox?), email the address to a personal email accoun. Here's the implementation,</p>

        <p>First off, since I was using a basic cronjob that would execute the script when ever the computer turned on, I needed to make sure that enough time had elapsed so that the script had enough time to establish an internet connection (I also set my desktop to turn on/off on a regular basis using System Preferences). Then I simply recorded the time for later purposes.
        </br>I then used a socket object that connected to a website, in this case gmail.com, and then grabbed the IP address by executing <code>socket.getsockname()</code>. This seemed to be the simplest solution that did require any parsing or sifting through string data, since it returns the socket's own address.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
          time.sleep(60)

          localtime = time.asctime( time.localtime(time.time()) ) 

          s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
          s.connect(("gmail.com",80))
          ip = s.getsockname()[0]
          s.close()

          msg = 'IP Address for iMac\n'
          msg += str(localtime)
          msg += '\n'
          msg += str(ip)
        </code></pre>

        <p>The next part was purely because after awhile I became annoyed with incessant emails when I was at home, so I simply decided to create/update a file in my dropbox that would contain the emails contents.</p>

        <pre><code>
          open('User/Dropbox/record/of/ipaddress.txt','w').close()
          f = open('User/Dropbox/record/of/ipaddress.txt', 'r+')
          f.write(msg)
        </code></pre>

        <p>Lastly, I took the message's contents and created a connection to gmail's servers, logged in under my own email account, sent the message to myself, and closed everything up.</p>

        <pre><code>
          server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com',587) #port 465 or 587
          server.ehlo()
          server.starttls()
          server.ehlo()
          server.login('your@email.com','password')
          server.sendmail('you@email.com','your@email.com',msg)
          server.close()
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>I still use this code everyday whenever I'm away from home. Absolutely useful to use the IP address to use Cyberduck or FileZilla and send/recieve files to and from my desktop to wherever I am. I know there are better options out there, this was simply a small project that helped solve an issue I had.</p>
