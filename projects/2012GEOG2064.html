        <h3>Global Economics and World Politics ... Spring 2012</h3>

          <p>A class I took my last semester of my college career, Global Economics and World Politics ended up being an incredibly useful and informative class. The structure of the class focused mainly on reading given books and writing, in essence, book reports on the knowledge and information from the various authors. What I liked most about the class was, surprisingly, the amount of writing involved. Unlike any of the other classes I participated in, this broke me away from the paradigm of usual economic classes. From taking this class, I was able to develop my communication and writing skills to effectively answer a given list of questions that would test my comprehension of the material I was intended to have focused on. I especially liked the subtle historical facts that shaped the global economy as it is today, ranging from early exploration of North America, to Karl Marx's formative theories on what would become the basis for capitalism, to how developed and developing nations interact to form a more solid global economy.</p>
