<h3>Projects & Work</h3>

<p><a>Work in Progress... Website Visualization Experiementation</a>
</br>Some experiementing (primarily with D3 code) I'm currently doing on how to take a different look at how a website is structured. The idea came about while I was explaining to my folks how a webpage's code is laid out. I also have been toying with the idea to create a resume based on tree structure.</p>

<p><a>Work in Progress... Disasters and Dr. Who</a>
</br>An "entertaining" page that illustrates the TARDIS' "reliable" navigation. Uses a collection of disasters in a Google Drive spreadsheet, converts the list to JSON, and then randomly matches aliens with events along with whooshing sounds and fade ins.</p>

<p><a>Emailing your IP Address</a>
</br>A simple explanation of a python script I used to send my desktop's IP address to me by email.</p>

<p><a>CSS Viewer</a>
</br>A simple (a rough draft) program designed to convert CSS files and information into a CSV file so that syntactically-correct mistakes can be spotted easily.</p>

<p><a>Human Computer Interaction Project &mdash; Basketball Event Tracking Interface</a>
</br>A summary of a project designed to study a simulated problem (recording basketball scores quickly and efficiently), research the different aspects that create the issue, then create a proof of concept that can be quantitatively shown to be an improvement to the issue.</p>

<p><a>Design of Information Capstone Project &mdash; Interactive Hallway Display</a>
</br>A general overview of my capstone group project, focused on designing and creating a proof of concept for a innovative visualization of information at the Virginia Tech Research Center &mdash; Arlington, Virginia.</p>
