<h3>Can you use iFrames instead of PHP <code>include()</code>?</h3>

<p>Sure.<br>How easy is it? In my experience, I've found it pretty unrelated.</p>

<p>I started thinking about this problem when trying to add some PHP to this very site as a means of keeping headers, navigation, footers, and just about anything I wanted to keep consistent through out the site. But since my site is hosted by Github, and since <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10837946/how-to-publish-php-page-instead-of-html-at-github-to-demo-some-php-content#answers-header" target='_top'>Github does not support PHP</a> (as far as I could tell), I wanted to see if there was an alternative solution.</p>

<p>Issues I've encountered so far:
	<li>Styling is a bit of a mess if you're adding on to an existing site.</li>
	<li>Scrollbar decides to stick around where it's beem unwanterd.</li>
	<li><code>allow-top-navigation</code> hasn't been working. (Turns out all I needed to do was to add <code>target='_top'</code> to the link)</li>
	<li>Refreshing the page causes to navigate back to the index page, i.e. loses the inner iframe content.</li>
