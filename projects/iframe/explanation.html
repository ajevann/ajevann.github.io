<h3>Can you use iFrames instead of PHP <code>include()</code>?</h3>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>How easy is it? In my experience, I've found it pretty unrelated.</p>
<p>I started thinking about this problem when trying to add some PHP to this very site as a means of keeping headers, navigation, footers, and just about anything I wanted to keep consistent through out the site. But since my site is hosted by Github, and since <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10837946/how-to-publish-php-page-instead-of-html-at-github-to-demo-some-php-content#answers-header">Github does not support PHP</a> (as far as I could tell), I wanted to see if there was an alternative solution.</p>
